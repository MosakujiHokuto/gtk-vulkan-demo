# GTK Vulkan Demo

This is my project for [SUSE Hackweek 23](https://hackweek.opensuse.org/projects/vulkan-widget-for-gtk), a Proof-of-Concept about rendering with Vulkan inside a GTK application.

# Build

```
$ make
```

# HERE BE DRAGON

This is a simple demo program, and thus is not intended to be well tested. Some of the values are hardcoded and may only work on my machine.
